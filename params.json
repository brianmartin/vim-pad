{"name":"vim-pad","body":"# vim-pad\r\n\r\nA quick notetaking plugin for vim.\r\n\r\nIt offers a way of managing notes similar to the one made popular by tools like\r\nNotational Velocity, where file management is removed from the notetaking\r\nworkflow, replaced by searching and sorting facilities, and where the creation\r\nand searching of notes are integrated.\r\n\r\nNotes in vim-pad are free-form: the plugin doesn't impose any format, and in\r\nfact encourages the use of any format you want, so you can use it along other\r\nplugins like VimOutliner and quicktask.\r\n\r\n![screen 1](http://i.minus.com/iOd0AOpCUXgu4.png)\r\n![screen 2](http://i.minus.com/i86fzuBua28Ox.png)\r\n![screen 3](http://i.minus.com/iwWXEI8oPZ4Wh.png)\r\n![screen 4](http://i.minus.com/it88jeH3qlKyO.png)\r\n\r\n## Branches\r\n\r\n* `master` contains the released version of the plugin.\r\n\r\n* `devel` contains the development version of the plugin. \r\n\r\nPull requests are to be done over `devel`.
